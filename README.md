# ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm for Extractive Summarization
[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9-3776AB?logo=Python&logoColor=white)](https://python.org/)

This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for extractive summarization. The process involves passing in your article, running the customized GA to retrieve the most important words, and then using the Groq API to generate a proper sentence from these words.

The implementation is based on the amazing article written by William Chen, Kensal Ramos, Kalyan Naidu Mullaguri, and Annie S. Wu - "Genetic Algorithms For Extractive Summarization".

## Features

1. **Input your article**: Provide the article you want to summarize.
2. **Run the algorithm**: Execute the GA to identify the most important words.
3. **Get your sentence**: Use the Groq API to generate a coherent sentence from the selected words.

You can customize various parameters in `main.py`, such as:
- Initial population size for GA
- Mutation probability
- Crossover probability
- Generation size
- And more...

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GA_Extractive_Summarization.git
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** with your Groq API key:
    ```plaintext
    API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```

4. **Run the main script**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the project:

1. **Input your article**:
    ```python
    article = """
    Most current work in NLP utilizes deep learning,
    which requires a lot of training data and computational power. This paper investigates the strengths
    of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for extractive summarization, as we hypothesized that GAs could
    construct more efficient solutions for the summarization task due to their relative customizability
    relative to deep learning models. This is done by
    building a vocabulary set, the words of which are
    represented as an array of weights, and 
    dictate sentence importance based on common English words.
    """
    ```

2. **Run the algorithm**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Get your sentence**:
    The output will be a coherent sentence generated from the most important words in the article.
